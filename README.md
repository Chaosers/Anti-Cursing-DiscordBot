# Anti-Cursing Bot
A simple discord bot I made with JDA to help moderate foul language within two large servers that I'm in. 

# Function
Everytime a message is sent in the server (does not matter what channel), the bot will take the message and compare it to a database of "banned words", checking if the message contains such a word. 

- If so, the sender will be timed out for one hour, and the owner of the server will receive a private message from the bot.
